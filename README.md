## Overview
This repository contains the implementation and verification of basic combinational digital circuits developed as part of **Task 1** of the **Xcelerium IC Design Training and Internship** program. The project focuses on RTL design using **SystemVerilog** and functional verification using **directed testbenches**.

---

## Implemented Modules
The following combinational circuits are designed and verified:

- **32-bit Adder**
- **32-bit Barrel Shifter**
- **8-to-3 Encoder**

Each module has a dedicated testbench to validate its functionality.

---

## Verification Strategy
The testbenches are written using **directed testing methodology**, including:
- Fixed directed test cases
- Random input test cases
- Edge case validation  

Simulation results are observed to ensure correctness of logic under all scenarios.
